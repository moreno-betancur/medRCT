This repository contains an R function to estimate interventional mediation effects that emulate a target RCT, as per the following paper:

Moreno-Betancur M, Moran P, Becker D, Patton GC, Carlin JB. "Mediation effects that emulate a target randomised trial: Simulation-based evaluation of ill-defined   interventions on multiple mediators". [https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06734](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06734)

[Click here](https://raw.githack.com/moreno-betancur/medRCT/master/Vignette.html) to access a guide on how to use this function with a worked example on simulated data.
